        Our goal is to show more people how to make origami while helping them improve their skills and promoting artists and others in the international paper folding community.
        If youâ€™ve never folded anything before and want to learn how, we have an excellent guide for beginners. We have a giant database of free diagrams and video instrutions too. Our blog features amazing work from a variety of very talented artists, we also have a collection of book reviews and recommendations plus much more!
